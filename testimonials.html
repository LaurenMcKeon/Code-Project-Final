<h2> John Murphy, Head of OPW, Dublin </h2>
<p><i> "We hired Summit for our large-scale restoration of Christchurch Cathedral in Dublin. They were the utmost professionals and were meticulous in their approach in reserving the historic beauty of the iconic building and completing the job to the agreed timelines. 
We would recommend Summit for any structures that require the manpower for large projects and attention to detail like no other."" </i><p>
